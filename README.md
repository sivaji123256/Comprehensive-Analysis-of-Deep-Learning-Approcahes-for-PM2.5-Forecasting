# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Deep-Learning-Approcahes-for-PM2.5-Forecasting
In this Repository ,We are implementing the different deep learning approaches for time series forcasting .
We have tested the Univariate PM2.5 data on four deep learning models namely LSTM ,GRU ,ConvLSTM  and also recently emerged Temporal convolutional Networks (TCN) to forecast the PM2.5 data.
